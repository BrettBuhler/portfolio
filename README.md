# Brett Buhler - Portfolo

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a full-stack software engineer.

## About

I am a full-stack software developer with expertise in the MERN stack. I hold a Master's degree in philosophy from the University of Waterloo and have worked in various industries, including Amazon and banking, before transitioning to software development. I have a passion for formal logic, which I combine with my analytical and problem-solving skills to create high-quality, user-friendly applications.

## Projects

The website features several of my projects, including:

- Opening Master: a full-stack MERN application designed to assist chess enthusiasts in improving their opening strategies.
- React Dash: a Front-End React application that I built to develop my skills in Front-End development, React knowledge, UI design, Component Libraries knowledge, and Data visualization abilities.
- Wordle Plus: a fun and engaging game that challenges players to guess a mystery word by trying out different letter combinations.
- Code Wars: a project that focuses on improving my knowledge of data structures and algorithms by completing coding challenges on Code Wars.

Each project includes a brief description, a link to the live site (if available), and a link to the GitHub repository.
